Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

An attacker can inject NoSQL queries into the request to retrieve user info without knowing
the username. This is solved by requiring the username to be a string and sanitizing that string
by removing non-alphanumeric characters to prevent injection.

This violates integrity.

An additional security mechanism to incorporate is encrypting sensitive data so that even if it is leaked,
the attacker would not gain as much useful information.

Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The session id in the cookie is saved on the user's browser and available across all sites during their current session.
This means another site can steal the session id. Also, another site can send a request to the insecure site, which will
automatically send that cookie which may result in secure information being sent back.

The secure version prevents against these issues by making the session id cookie same site only, so it isn't used on other
sites, and httpOnly, so other sites cannot programmatically access the cookie information.

This violates confidentiality.

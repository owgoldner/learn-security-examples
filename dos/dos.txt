- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability is that sending invalid input as id in the request can cause the server to crash.
The secure version solves this by using a try-catch block to catch invalid input. Another security
mechanism to help protect against DOS attacks is a rate limit middleware.

- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The logging in the insecure server may not be secure, and there is no other implementation to keep track
of requests. For example, an attacker could crash the server through a DOS attack, and then if the server
is rebooted prior logging through console.log may be lost. The secure version prevents this by saving logs
to the server file system during important events like requests, errors, and authentication. Additionally,
we can ensure the log file is secured and immune to tampering. You might also want some mechanism like clearing
old logs to another system to avoid running out of space. Also implement an automated auditing process to look
for suspicious behavior in the logs.
